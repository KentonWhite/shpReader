# shpReader

This package provides a [shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile)
reader function to be used with
[ProjectTemplate](https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/ProjectTemplate).

Include shpReader as a required package (in `config/global.dcf`) to enable
ProjectTemplate to read your `.shp` files in the `data` folder.
